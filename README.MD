### my first try to react in ASP.NET

its quite different
i created an empty .NET MCV 4.6.1 Webproject in the visual studio
i prepared a controller for the home route\
i created the Scripts/react folder which is under control of npm\
so here, as we are used to\
```npm run webpack:dev``` it contains a watcher\
```npm run ts:watch ``` and the TS would be watched
```npm run dev```combines both of the above in one command
consider this folder as root of the JS app and develop it here\

one needs to start he vstudio IIS-Express server and reload here\
